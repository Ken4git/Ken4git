### Hello world ;)

I am writing so I may exist. Hum, no I am thinking so I may exist.
However...
What about the I? When saying "I", is that myself who is speaking? When are my thoughts transformed
into some saying "I", or even thinking "I"...
For sure "some" thoughts happen, so something is, the thought... 

... I should think about that...
